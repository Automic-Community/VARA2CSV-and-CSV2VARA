Documenation and Instructions
---

<p>Do you regularily need to change the content of huge VARAs? Then this is possibly something for you. The 2 SCRI objects easily attach to the context-menu of your AE client so you can select any VARA (static, SQL, filelist - doesn't matter at all) to export it's content directly into a CSV file that can be stored on any OS agent.</p>
<p>Importing is possible as well (however only into static VARA).</p>
